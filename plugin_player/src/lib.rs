//! # Player Plugin for Horizon GORC System
//!
//! This crate provides a complete player management system for the Horizon game engine,
//! implementing the GORC (Game Object Replication and Communication) architecture for
//! distributed multiplayer gaming.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The Player Plugin manages the complete lifecycle of players in the game world:
//! - **Connection Management**: Player join/leave events and resource allocation
//! - **Movement System**: Real-time position updates with spatial replication
//! - **Combat System**: Weapon firing and combat event distribution
//! - **Communication**: Chat and messaging between nearby players
//! - **Scanning System**: Detailed ship information sharing at close range
//!
//! ## GORC Architecture
//!
//! The plugin utilizes GORC's multi-channel communication system:
//!
//! | Channel | Purpose            | Range | Frequency    | Examples                   |
//! |---------|--------------------|-------|--------------|----------------------------|
//! | 0       | Critical movement  | 25m   | 60Hz         | Position, velocity, health |
//! | 1       | Combat events      | 500m  | Event-driven | Weapon fire, explosions    |
//! | 2       | Communication      | 300m  | Event-driven | Chat, voice, emotes        |
//! | 3       | Detailed scanning  | 100m  | Event-driven | Ship specs, cargo          |
//!
//! ## Security Model
//!
//! All player interactions include comprehensive security validation:
//! - **Authentication**: Only authenticated connections can send requests
//! - **Ownership**: Players can only control their own ships and objects
//! - **Input Validation**: All data is validated for bounds and format
//! - **Anti-Cheat**: Movement and combat include anti-exploitation measures
//!
//! ## Performance Characteristics
//!
//! The system is designed for high-performance multiplayer gaming:
//! - **Spatial Culling**: Events only replicate to relevant nearby players
//! - **Async Processing**: All handlers use non-blocking async operations
//! - **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal allocations during steady-state operation
//! - **Scalable Architecture**: Supports hundreds of concurrent players per instance
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use plugin_player::PlayerPlugin;
//! use horizon_event_system::create_simple_plugin;
//!
//! // The plugin is automatically registered using the create_simple_plugin! macro
//! // and provides complete player management out of the box
//! ```
//!
//! ## Module Organization
//!
//! - [`player`] - Core player object and GORC integration
//! - [`events`] - Event data structures and serialization
//! - [`handlers`] - Specialized event handlers for different game systems

/// The core Player Plugin implementation for the Horizon GORC system.
///
/// This plugin provides comprehensive player management including connection lifecycle,
/// real-time movement replication, combat event handling, communication systems,
/// and detailed ship scanning capabilities.
///
/// ## Architecture
///
/// The plugin follows the GORC (Game Object Replication and Communication) pattern:
/// - Players are registered as GORC objects with spatial awareness
/// - Events are processed through specialized handlers for different game systems
/// - All communication uses multi-channel GORC messaging for optimal performance
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// The plugin is designed for high-concurrency operation:
/// - Player registry uses `DashMap` for lock-free concurrent access
/// - All handlers are async and non-blocking
/// - Event processing is distributed across multiple async tasks
///
/// ## Resource Management
///
/// - **Player Registry**: Maps player IDs to GORC object IDs for efficient cleanup
/// - **Automatic Cleanup**: Players are removed from all systems on disconnect
/// - **Memory Efficient**: Uses shared references and zero-copy operations where possible
pub struct PlayerPlugin {
    /// Human-readable name of the plugin
    name: String,
    /// Thread-safe registry mapping PlayerId to GorcObjectId for resource management
    /// This allows efficient lookup during movement, combat, and cleanup operations
    players: Arc<DashMap<PlayerId, GorcObjectId>>,
}

impl PlayerPlugin {

    /// Initializes the plugin with:
    /// - Empty player registry for tracking active players
    /// - Default plugin name for identification in logs
    /// - Thread-safe data structures for concurrent operation
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// A new `PlayerPlugin` instance ready for registration with the event system.
    ///
    /// # Example
    ///
    /// ```rust
    /// use plugin_player::PlayerPlugin;
    ///
    /// let plugin = PlayerPlugin::new();
    /// // Plugin is now ready to be registered with the server
    /// ```

    ///
    /// ## Handler Registration
    ///
    /// - **Connection Handlers**: Core player lifecycle (connect/disconnect)
    /// - **Movement Handler**: GORC channel 0 for real-time position updates
    /// - **Combat Handler**: GORC channel 1 for weapon firing and combat events
    /// - **Communication Handler**: GORC channel 2 for chat and messaging
    /// - **Scanning Handler**: GORC channel 3 for detailed ship information
    ///
    /// ## Event System Integration
    ///
    /// The plugin integrates with both core server events and GORC client events:
    /// - Core events handle server-side lifecycle management
    /// - GORC events process client requests with spatial replication
    ///
    /// # Parameters

    /// - `context`: Server context providing logging and async runtime access

    /// // Each handler processes specific event types and channels
