//! # Player Connection Handler
//! 
//! Manages the complete lifecycle of player connections within the GORC system.
//! This module handles the critical events of players joining and leaving the game world,
//! ensuring proper resource allocation, cleanup, and integration with the spatial
//! replication system.
//! 
//! ## Key Responsibilities
//! 
//! - **Player Registration**: Creates and registers new GORC player objects when clients connect
//! - **Spatial Integration**: Adds players to the zone-based replication system
//! - **Resource Management**: Tracks player-to-object mappings for efficient cleanup
//! - **Graceful Cleanup**: Removes players and their associated objects on disconnect
//! 
//! ## Connection Flow
//! 
//! 1. **PlayerConnectedEvent** received from core event system
//! 2. Create new `GorcPlayer` object with default spawn position
//! 3. Register object with GORC instances manager (returns unique ID)
//! 4. Update player position to trigger zone message distribution
//! 5. Add player to spatial tracking system
//! 6. Store mapping for future cleanup
//! 
//! ## Disconnection Flow
//! 
//! 1. **PlayerDisconnectedEvent** received from core event system
//! 2. Lookup stored GORC object ID for the player
//! 3. Remove player from all tracking systems
//! 4. Clean up resource mappings
//! 
//! ## Error Handling
//! 
//! All connection operations are designed to be fault-tolerant:
//! - Missing GORC instances manager is logged but doesn't crash the plugin
//! - Failed registrations are properly logged with context
//! - Cleanup operations are idempotent and safe to retry
